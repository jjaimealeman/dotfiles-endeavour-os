Clouds are formed when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing the water vapor in the air to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. This cooling is often due to changes in atmospheric pressure, the presence of a front, or the rising of warm air over a cooler surface (such as a mountain). As the droplets or ice crystals combine and grow in size, they form visible clouds in the sky. The type of cloud that forms depends on the temperature, humidity, and altitude of the air, as well as the presence of other particles like dust and pollution.
